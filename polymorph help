`{prefix}{alias} <creature>` -  replace your existing character in init with the named creature carrying across all effects, spells etc.
`{prefix}{alias} end` - end the polymorph and place your character back in init with all effects spells etc

Polymorph can also be used on other creatures in combat

`{prefix}{alias} <creature> -t <target>` - replace the target in init with the named creature carrying across all effects, spells etc.
`{prefix}{alias} end` - end the polymorph and place the original back in init with all effects spells etc

If the polymorphed target is a player character then the player of that character must be the one to use `{prefix}{alias} end`
