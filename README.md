# transformations
_This is a set of aliases to manage rules and effects which transform creatures in initiative_

It will start off with the most popular transformations !wildshape and !polymorph

This will be a PHB 2024 rules set of aliases - updated to the new rules.

These aliases will switch a creature in initiative with the thing they transform into . Then when the same alias is called with the end argument they will switch back and restore the original creature (usually a character). Each transformation will carry across all of the spells, effects etc that are on the transformed creature and will transfer back those in effect when the transform ends.

The aliases here are compatible with the !map alias - when transforming the new transform creature will be placed on the map where it should be.
